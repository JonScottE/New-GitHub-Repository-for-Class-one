### Soooo Handsome!!!

### table of contents description
-[chapter 1](#chapter1)

I grew up in Chicago, and went to undergrad at UVM where I studied Economics.

My first real job was at a subprime mortgage bank, I then got my real estate license, and wen on to brokerage, opening my own office, and property development.

I've also sold CRM software at a small company and got very familiar with the project managers, backends for customer service reasons, and ultimately relational databases.

Having owned my own company and developed our own database and website, I also became quite familiar with HTML, and while selling websites to real esstate agents, it furthered my comfort level with code and tech.

My career goals are to move beyond brokerage as a primary profession.  That being said, my personality doesn't always jive with larger companies, so doing something for myself may also be the best path :-)

I choose Fintech because it's ultimately a perfect culmination of my education history, work history, and personal interest. 

And because I believe BTC and Crypto is the future internet, and we're barely scratching the surface.
